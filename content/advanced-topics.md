# Remote Builds

Nix supports remote builds, where a local Nix installation can forward
Nix builds to other machines. This allows multiple builds to be
performed in parallel and allows Nix to perform multi-platform builds in
a semi-transparent way. For instance, if you perform a build for a
`x86_64-darwin` on an `i686-linux` machine, Nix can automatically
forward the build to a `x86_64-darwin` machine, if available.

To forward a build to a remote machine, it’s required that the remote
machine is accessible via SSH and that it has Nix installed. You can
test whether connecting to the remote Nix instance works, e.g.

    $ nix ping-store --store ssh://mac

will try to connect to the machine named `mac`. It is possible to
specify an SSH identity file as part of the remote store URI, e.g.

    $ nix ping-store --store ssh://mac?ssh-key=/home/alice/my-key

Since builds should be non-interactive, the key should not have a
passphrase. Alternatively, you can load identities ahead of time into
`ssh-agent` or `gpg-agent`.

If you get the error

    bash: nix-store: command not found
    error: cannot connect to 'mac'

then you need to ensure that the `PATH` of non-interactive login shells
contains Nix.

<div class="warning">

If you are building via the Nix daemon, it is the Nix daemon user
account (that is, `root`) that should have SSH access to the remote
machine. If you can’t or don’t want to configure `root` to be able to
access to remote machine, you can use a private Nix store instead by
passing e.g. `--store ~/my-nix`.

</div>

The list of remote machines can be specified on the command line or in
the Nix configuration file. The former is convenient for testing. For
example, the following command allows you to build a derivation for
`x86_64-darwin` on a Linux machine:

    $ uname
    Linux

    $ nix build \
      '(with import <nixpkgs> { system = "x86_64-darwin"; }; runCommand "foo" {} "uname > $out")' \
      --builders 'ssh://mac x86_64-darwin'
    [1/0/1 built, 0.0 MiB DL] building foo on ssh://mac

    $ cat ./result
    Darwin

It is possible to specify multiple builders separated by a semicolon or
a newline, e.g.

```
  --builders 'ssh://mac x86_64-darwin ; ssh://beastie x86_64-freebsd'
```

Each machine specification consists of the following elements, separated
by spaces. Only the first element is required. To leave a field at its
default, set it to `-`.

1.  The URI of the remote store in the format
    `ssh://[username@]hostname`, e.g. `ssh://nix@mac` or `ssh://mac`.
    For backward compatibility, `ssh://` may be omitted. The hostname
    may be an alias defined in your `~/.ssh/config`.

2.  A comma-separated list of Nix platform type identifiers, such as
    `x86_64-darwin`. It is possible for a machine to support multiple
    platform types, e.g., `i686-linux,x86_64-linux`. If omitted, this
    defaults to the local platform type.

3.  The SSH identity file to be used to log in to the remote machine. If
    omitted, SSH will use its regular identities.

4.  The maximum number of builds that Nix will execute in parallel on
    the machine. Typically this should be equal to the number of CPU
    cores. For instance, the machine `itchy` in the example will execute
    up to 8 builds in parallel.

5.  The “speed factor”, indicating the relative speed of the machine. If
    there are multiple machines of the right type, Nix will prefer the
    fastest, taking load into account.

6.  A comma-separated list of *supported features*. If a derivation has
    the `requiredSystemFeatures` attribute, then Nix will only perform
    the derivation on a machine that has the specified features. For
    instance, the attribute

        requiredSystemFeatures = [ "kvm" ];

    will cause the build to be performed on a machine that has the `kvm`
    feature.

7.  A comma-separated list of *mandatory features*. A machine will only
    be used to build a derivation if all of the machine’s mandatory
    features appear in the derivation’s `requiredSystemFeatures`
    attribute..

For example, the machine specification

    nix@scratchy.labs.cs.uu.nl  i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        8 1 kvm
    nix@itchy.labs.cs.uu.nl     i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        8 2
    nix@poochie.labs.cs.uu.nl   i686-linux      /home/nix/.ssh/id_scratchy_auto        1 2 kvm benchmark

specifies several machines that can perform `i686-linux` builds.
However, `poochie` will only do builds that have the attribute

    requiredSystemFeatures = [ "benchmark" ];

or

    requiredSystemFeatures = [ "benchmark" "kvm" ];

`itchy` cannot do builds that require `kvm`, but `scratchy` does support
such builds. For regular builds, `itchy` will be preferred over
`scratchy` because it has a higher speed factor.

Remote builders can also be configured in `nix.conf`, e.g.

    builders = ssh://mac x86_64-darwin ; ssh://beastie x86_64-freebsd

Finally, remote builders can be configured in a separate configuration
file included in `builders` via the syntax `@file`. For example,

    builders = @/etc/nix/machines

causes the list of machines in `/etc/nix/machines` to be included. (This
is the default.)

If you want the builders to use caches, you likely want to set the
option [`builders-use-substitutes`](#conf-builders-use-substitutes) in
your local `nix.conf`.

To build only on remote builders and disable building on the local
machine, you can use the option `--max-jobs 0`.

# Tuning Cores and Jobs

Nix has two relevant settings with regards to how your CPU cores will be
utilized: [varlistentry\_title](#conf-cores) and
[varlistentry\_title](#conf-max-jobs). This chapter will talk about what
they are, how they interact, and their configuration trade-offs.

  - [varlistentry\_title](#conf-max-jobs)
    Dictates how many separate derivations will be built at the same
    time. If you set this to zero, the local machine will do no builds.
    Nix will still substitute from binary caches, and build remotely if
    remote builders are configured.

  - [varlistentry\_title](#conf-cores)
    Suggests how many cores each derivation should use. Similar to `make
    -j`.

The [varlistentry\_title](#conf-cores) setting determines the value of
`NIX_BUILD_CORES`. `NIX_BUILD_CORES` is equal to
[varlistentry\_title](#conf-cores), unless
[varlistentry\_title](#conf-cores) equals `0`, in which case
`NIX_BUILD_CORES` will be the total number of cores in the system.

The maximum number of consumed cores is a simple multiplication,
[varlistentry\_title](#conf-max-jobs) \* `NIX_BUILD_CORES`.

The balance on how to set these two independent variables depends upon
each builder's workload and hardware. Here are a few example scenarios
on a machine with 24 cores:

<table>
<caption>Balancing 24 Build Cores</caption>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><a href="#conf-max-jobs">varlistentry_title</a></th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>

<tr class="odd">

<td>6</td>
<td>6</td>
<td>72</td>
<td>12 derivations will be built at once, each given access to six cores. This configuration is over-sold. If all 12 derivations being built simultaneously try to use all six cores, the machine's performance will be degraded due to extensive context switching between the 12 builds.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>24</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>24</td>
<td>24 derivations can build at the same time, each using a single core. Never oversold, but derivations which require many cores will be very slow to compile.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>24</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>24</td>
<td>576</td>
<td>24 derivations can build at the same time, each using all the available cores of the machine. Very likely to be oversold, and very likely to suffer context switches.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

It is up to the derivations' build script to respect host's requested
cores-per-build by following the value of the `NIX_BUILD_CORES`
environment variable.

# Verifying Build Reproducibility with `diff-hook`

Specify a program with Nix's [varlistentry\_title](#conf-diff-hook) to
compare build results when two builds produce different results. Note:
this hook is only executed if the results are not the same, this hook is
not used for determining if the results are the same.

For purposes of demonstration, we'll use the following Nix file,
`deterministic.nix` for testing:

    let
      inherit (import <nixpkgs> {}) runCommand;
    in {
      stable = runCommand "stable" {} ''
        touch $out
      '';

      unstable = runCommand "unstable" {} ''
        echo $RANDOM > $out
      '';
    }

Additionally, `nix.conf` contains:

    diff-hook = /etc/nix/my-diff-hook
    run-diff-hook = true

where `/etc/nix/my-diff-hook` is an executable file containing:

    #!/bin/sh
    exec >&2
    echo "For derivation $3:"
    /run/current-system/sw/bin/diff -r "$1" "$2"

The diff hook is executed by the same user and group who ran the build.
However, the diff hook does not have write access to the store path just
built.

## Spot-Checking Build Determinism

Verify a path which already exists in the Nix store by passing `--check`
to the build command.

If the build passes and is deterministic, Nix will exit with a status
code of 0:

    $ nix-build ./deterministic.nix -A stable
    these derivations will be built:
      /nix/store/z98fasz2jqy9gs0xbvdj939p27jwda38-stable.drv
    building '/nix/store/z98fasz2jqy9gs0xbvdj939p27jwda38-stable.drv'...
    /nix/store/yyxlzw3vqaas7wfp04g0b1xg51f2czgq-stable

    $ nix-build ./deterministic.nix -A stable --check
    checking outputs of '/nix/store/z98fasz2jqy9gs0xbvdj939p27jwda38-stable.drv'...
    /nix/store/yyxlzw3vqaas7wfp04g0b1xg51f2czgq-stable

If the build is not deterministic, Nix will exit with a status code of
1:

    $ nix-build ./deterministic.nix -A unstable
    these derivations will be built:
      /nix/store/cgl13lbj1w368r5z8gywipl1ifli7dhk-unstable.drv
    building '/nix/store/cgl13lbj1w368r5z8gywipl1ifli7dhk-unstable.drv'...
    /nix/store/krpqk0l9ib0ibi1d2w52z293zw455cap-unstable

    $ nix-build ./deterministic.nix -A unstable --check
    checking outputs of '/nix/store/cgl13lbj1w368r5z8gywipl1ifli7dhk-unstable.drv'...
    error: derivation '/nix/store/cgl13lbj1w368r5z8gywipl1ifli7dhk-unstable.drv' may not be deterministic: output '/nix/store/krpqk0l9ib0ibi1d2w52z293zw455cap-unstable' differs

In the Nix daemon's log, we will now see:

    For derivation /nix/store/cgl13lbj1w368r5z8gywipl1ifli7dhk-unstable.drv:
    1c1
    < 8108
    ---
    > 30204

Using `--check` with `--keep-failed` will cause Nix to keep the second
build's output in a special, `.check` path:

    $ nix-build ./deterministic.nix -A unstable --check --keep-failed
    checking outputs of '/nix/store/cgl13lbj1w368r5z8gywipl1ifli7dhk-unstable.drv'...
    note: keeping build directory '/tmp/nix-build-unstable.drv-0'
    error: derivation '/nix/store/cgl13lbj1w368r5z8gywipl1ifli7dhk-unstable.drv' may not be deterministic: output '/nix/store/krpqk0l9ib0ibi1d2w52z293zw455cap-unstable' differs from '/nix/store/krpqk0l9ib0ibi1d2w52z293zw455cap-unstable.check'

In particular, notice the
`/nix/store/krpqk0l9ib0ibi1d2w52z293zw455cap-unstable.check` output. Nix
has copied the build results to that directory where you can examine it.

> `.check` paths are not registered store paths
>
> Check paths are not protected against garbage collection, and this
> path will be deleted on the next garbage collection.
>
> The path is guaranteed to be alive for the duration of
> [varlistentry\_title](#conf-diff-hook)'s execution, but may be
> deleted any time after.
>

`--check` is only usable if the derivation has been built on the system
already. If the derivation has not been built Nix will fail with the
error:

    error: some outputs of '/nix/store/hzi1h60z2qf0nb85iwnpvrai3j2w7rr6-unstable.drv' are not valid, so checking is not possible

Run the build without `--check`, and then try with `--check` again.

## Automatic and Optionally Enforced Determinism Verification

Automatically verify every build at build time by executing the build
multiple times.

Setting [varlistentry\_title](#conf-repeat) and
[varlistentry\_title](#conf-enforce-determinism) in your `nix.conf`
permits the automated verification of every build Nix performs.

The following configuration will run each build three times, and will
require the build to be deterministic:

    enforce-determinism = true
    repeat = 2

Setting [varlistentry\_title](#conf-enforce-determinism) to false as in
the following configuration will run the build multiple times, execute
the build hook, but will allow the build to succeed even if it does not
build reproducibly:

    enforce-determinism = false
    repeat = 1

An example output of this configuration:

    $ nix-build ./test.nix -A unstable
    these derivations will be built:
      /nix/store/ch6llwpr2h8c3jmnf3f2ghkhx59aa97f-unstable.drv
    building '/nix/store/ch6llwpr2h8c3jmnf3f2ghkhx59aa97f-unstable.drv' (round 1/2)...
    building '/nix/store/ch6llwpr2h8c3jmnf3f2ghkhx59aa97f-unstable.drv' (round 2/2)...
    output '/nix/store/6xg356v9gl03hpbbg8gws77n19qanh02-unstable' of '/nix/store/ch6llwpr2h8c3jmnf3f2ghkhx59aa97f-unstable.drv' differs from '/nix/store/6xg356v9gl03hpbbg8gws77n19qanh02-unstable.check' from previous round
    /nix/store/6xg356v9gl03hpbbg8gws77n19qanh02-unstable

# Using the `post-build-hook`

## Implementation Caveats

Here we use the post-build hook to upload to a binary cache. This is a
simple and working example, but it is not suitable for all use cases.

The post build hook program runs after each executed build, and blocks
the build loop. The build loop exits if the hook program fails.

Concretely, this implementation will make Nix slow or unusable when the
internet is slow or unreliable.

A more advanced implementation might pass the store paths to a
user-supplied daemon or queue for processing the store paths outside of
the build loop.

## Prerequisites

This tutorial assumes you have configured an S3-compatible binary cache
according to the instructions at [Authenticated Writes to your
S3-compatible binary cache](#ssec-s3-substituter-authenticated-writes),
and that the `root` user's default AWS profile can upload to the bucket.

## Set up a Signing Key

Use `nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key` to create our public and
private signing keys. We will sign paths with the private key, and
distribute the public key for verifying the authenticity of the paths.

    # nix-store --generate-binary-cache-key example-nix-cache-1 /etc/nix/key.private /etc/nix/key.public
    # cat /etc/nix/key.public
    example-nix-cache-1:1/cKDz3QCCOmwcztD2eV6Coggp6rqc9DGjWv7C0G+rM=

Then, add the public key and the cache URL to your `nix.conf`'s
[varlistentry\_title](#conf-trusted-public-keys) and
[varlistentry\_title](#conf-substituters) like:

    substituters = https://cache.nixos.org/ s3://example-nix-cache
    trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY= example-nix-cache-1:1/cKDz3QCCOmwcztD2eV6Coggp6rqc9DGjWv7C0G+rM=

We will restart the Nix daemon in a later step.

## Implementing the build hook

Write the following script to `/etc/nix/upload-to-cache.sh`:

    #!/bin/sh

    set -eu
    set -f # disable globbing
    export IFS=' '

    echo "Signing paths" $OUT_PATHS
    nix sign-paths --key-file /etc/nix/key.private $OUT_PATHS
    echo "Uploading paths" $OUT_PATHS
    exec nix copy --to 's3://example-nix-cache' $OUT_PATHS

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Should `$OUT_PATHS` be quoted?

</div>

The `$OUT_PATHS` variable is a space-separated list of Nix store paths.
In this case, we expect and want the shell to perform word splitting to
make each output path its own argument to `nix sign-paths`. Nix
guarantees the paths will not contain any spaces, however a store path
might contain glob characters. The `set -f` disables globbing in the
shell.

</div>

Then make sure the hook program is executable by the `root` user:

    # chmod +x /etc/nix/upload-to-cache.sh

## Updating Nix Configuration

Edit `/etc/nix/nix.conf` to run our hook, by adding the following
configuration snippet at the end:

    post-build-hook = /etc/nix/upload-to-cache.sh

Then, restart the `nix-daemon`.

## Testing

Build any derivation, for example:

    $ nix-build -E '(import <nixpkgs> {}).writeText "example" (builtins.toString builtins.currentTime)'
    these derivations will be built:
      /nix/store/s4pnfbkalzy5qz57qs6yybna8wylkig6-example.drv
    building '/nix/store/s4pnfbkalzy5qz57qs6yybna8wylkig6-example.drv'...
    running post-build-hook '/home/grahamc/projects/github.com/NixOS/nix/post-hook.sh'...
    post-build-hook: Signing paths /nix/store/ibcyipq5gf91838ldx40mjsp0b8w9n18-example
    post-build-hook: Uploading paths /nix/store/ibcyipq5gf91838ldx40mjsp0b8w9n18-example
    /nix/store/ibcyipq5gf91838ldx40mjsp0b8w9n18-example

Then delete the path from the store, and try substituting it from the
binary cache:

    $ rm ./result
    $ nix-store --delete /nix/store/ibcyipq5gf91838ldx40mjsp0b8w9n18-example

Now, copy the path back from the cache:

    $ nix-store --realise /nix/store/ibcyipq5gf91838ldx40mjsp0b8w9n18-example
    copying path '/nix/store/m8bmqwrch6l3h8s0k3d673xpmipcdpsa-example from 's3://example-nix-cache'...
    warning: you did not specify '--add-root'; the result might be removed by the garbage collector
    /nix/store/m8bmqwrch6l3h8s0k3d673xpmipcdpsa-example

## Conclusion

We now have a Nix installation configured to automatically sign and
upload every local build to a remote binary cache.

Before deploying this to production, be sure to consider the
implementation caveats in [Implementation
Caveats](#chap-post-build-hook-caveats).
